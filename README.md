# PermissionChanger
PermissionChanger is an application to switch folder permission easily from any permission to read-only, back and force.

The PermissionChanger is running in System-Tray. You can add folders and switch the "read-only" permission on and off.

The application is written in C#.NET and requires .NET Framework 4.5.2.
I've tested the application in Windows 7 x64 and Windows 10 x64.
